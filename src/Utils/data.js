        comment:`It's hard to imagine life before Cubicle in a lot of ways. All the features & functionality we like about Cubicle didn't exist at the time; we were using 2-3 different VDR providers before ultimately standardizing on Cubicle as a serial acquirer.\nIt’s helped getting that data into the data room down to a science.`

Cubicle, allows us, Shippr, to focus in on our business.\nOur business is not to manage data. It's not to get data in. It's not to control the data. It's to understand that we need that data, and to make sure it's in the right place, at the right time.`
